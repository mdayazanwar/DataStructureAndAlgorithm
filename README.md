A **binary tree** is a type of tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. These children are also nodes in the tree, and they are positioned relative to their parent node. Here are some key points about binary trees:

**Root:** The topmost node in the tree is called the root. It is the starting point for traversing the tree.

**Parent, Child, Sibling:** A node in a binary tree can have at most one parent but can have at most two children. Nodes that share the same parent are called siblings.

**Internal Nodes and Leaves:** Nodes that have at least one child are called internal nodes. Nodes that have no children are called leaves or external nodes.

**Height:** The height of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf node. The height of an empty tree is typically defined as -1, and the height of a tree with only one node (the root) is 0.

**Binary Search Tree (BST):** A binary search tree is a binary tree in which each node has a value, and for each node, all values in the left subtree are less than the node's value, and all values in the right subtree are greater than the node's value. This property makes binary search trees useful for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

**Traversal:** There are three common ways to traverse a binary tree: inorder, preorder, and postorder. In inorder traversal, the left subtree is visited first, then the current node, and finally the right subtree. In preorder traversal, the current node is visited first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree. In postorder traversal, the left subtree is visited first, then the right subtree, and finally the current node.

Binary trees are used in a wide variety of applications, including binary search trees for searching and sorting, expression trees for representing mathematical expressions, and hierarchical data structures like file systems and organization charts.
